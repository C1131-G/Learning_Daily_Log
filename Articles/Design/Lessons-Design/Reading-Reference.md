## 01 — Find your conceptual models

**Core idea:** Products need a strong conceptual model to stay coherent as they grow. Start with a framework, then explore bold ideas before narrowing.

**Key takeaways**
- A solid conceptual model keeps a product consistent as features expand.
- Push beyond perceived constraints to discover unexpected solutions.
- Validate ideas by contrasting them with distinct alternatives.
- When two ideas conflict, search for a third idea that resolves the tension.
- Expand your references beyond the usual design bubble.

**Practices**
- Break assumptions: write three “impossible” solutions before settling on a feasible one.
- Test your model against extremes to clarify what truly matters.

## 02 — Simplicity is saying no

**Core idea:** Simplicity is achieved by removing what doesn’t belong. It’s about clarity, not emptiness.

**Key takeaways**
- Redundancy is the enemy of clarity—merge or remove repeated elements.
- Not everything needs to be visible at once; reveal progressively over time.
- Saying no can be graceful; it’s a design skill and a communication skill.
- “Perfection” is when nothing essential remains to be removed.
- The pixels you don’t use are as important as the ones you do.
- Usefulness matters more than raw usability.
- If a feature explanation needs “and/also,” it may be doing too much.
- Writing is UI: strong words reduce UI complexity.

**Practices**
- Subtract before adding.
- Tighten labels and CTAs as a simplification tool.

## 03 — Framing is magic

**Core idea:** Design decisions are invisible unless framed. Framing makes reasoning legible and builds alignment.

**Key takeaways**
- Framing your work is a form of seeing; it helps others see too.
- Use names, stories, metaphors, data, or moodboards—whatever fits the moment.
- If people agree with the frame, discussions about details become easier.
- Don’t give a “real estate tour.” Explain outcomes and motivations.
- Stakeholder alignment comes from understanding their motivations.
- Humanize product design; bring personality and beauty into the work.

**Practices**
- Write a short “origin story” for each design direction.
- Start reviews with user outcomes, not UI parts.

## 04 — Consistency compounds

**Core idea:** Consistency is the most important technical skill in digital product design. It scales trust and quality.

**Key takeaways**
- Consistency helps teams scale and helps users learn faster.
- Proofread everything: fonts, spacing, components, copy, presentations.
- Choose consistency over intensity; it makes things last.
- Attention to detail earns respect and preserves craft.
- Consistency should not override contextual needs.

**Practices**
- Perform a “consistency audit” before every handoff.
- Give private feedback when you spot inconsistencies in others’ work.

## 05 — Chaos is rarely a bad thing

**Core idea:** Systems are essential, but memorability comes from knowing when to bend or break them.

**Key takeaways**
- A rigid system can make products indistinguishable.
- Break rules with a rationale; explain your intent.
- Explore big shifts to unlock fresh ideas (scale, contrast, flow order).
- Transgressions should be loving, not careless.
- Generalists often spot opportunities for magical moments.
- Users remember experiences, not design systems.

**Practices**
- For each flow, propose one intentional rule-break and test it.

## 06 — Change is the only way

**Core idea:** Design is about making things better; it requires perseverance through constraints and change.

**Key takeaways**
- If you’re not meaningfully improving something, reconsider doing it.
- Progress beats perfection—ship daily steps toward the final state.
- Designing doesn’t end at the artboard; shipping is the real work.
- Expect repeated presentations and keep your energy consistent.
- The shipped version will differ; protect the core idea.
- Constraints are constants; adapt instead of waiting for ideal conditions.
- Find the enemy (often mediocrity) to fuel your motivation.
- You only get to design so many things—choose intentionally.
- Make new mistakes, not the same ones.

**Practices**
- Define the “non-negotiable core” before iteration cycles begin.

## 07 — Joy is the real legacy

**Core idea:** Design is a team sport; your real legacy is how you treat people.

**Key takeaways**
- Seek joy at work; it changes the tone and outcome.
- Ignore titles; let ideas, not hierarchy, lead conversations.
- Courtesy is free and powerful.
- Give credit generously; it’s a designer’s currency.
- Criticize privately, praise publicly.
- Humor and playfulness lower walls and build trust.
- Don’t ask for a seat at the table—add value until you’re invited.
- Your legacy is people’s growth and how you made them feel.

**Practices**
- End critiques with one public celebration of someone’s work.

## Personal re-read checklist

When revisiting this guide, ask:
- What’s the conceptual model behind the thing I’m designing?
- Where can I subtract for clarity?
- What frame will help others understand and align?
- Where is consistency missing, and where should we break it?
- What change do I need to fight for, despite constraints?
- How can I create more joy for the people around me?
